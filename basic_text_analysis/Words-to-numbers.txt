Our agri-business is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and is subject 
to changing technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of 
new products and services. Our ability to compete successfully depends 
heavily on providing products and services. "Sincerely, James' O'Shawnee"
